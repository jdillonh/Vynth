Check it out [here](https://jdillonh.github.io/Vynth/).

## What is it?
Vynth (name pending) is a video-synthesizer, inspired by analog video synthesizers, 
that runs in your browser.

It presents an interface familiar to users of Max/MSP/Jitter or other visual programming 
environments, and is an easy way to play with graphics programs without having to 
type them out by hand.

## How do I use it?
Coming soon.

## How does it work?
Vynth patches compile into glsl fragment shaders which are layed over a square geometry.
Each module represents a glsl function, uniform value, or other abstraction. 
The compiled shaders are usually pretty simple, you can check them out in the console.
